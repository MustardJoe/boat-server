# Welcome to my Twin Peaks REST Api!

**General Info:** I am a huge fan of the David Lynch TV show Twin Peaks. I also love working on server-side JavaScript projects. REST APIs are an increasingly popular way to provide data to (an otherwise interface with) client-side and other services in a way that is friendly, tech-stack agnositc, and easy to consume. At some point I noticed there was no REST API for Twin Peaks related content, so I made a mental note to eventually correct that oversight, and thus I now present my Twin Peaks REST API for public consumtion. Currently this API contains a collection of Characters from the show, and Quotes attributed to the show's characters. I hope you enjoy your time in Twin Peaks!
